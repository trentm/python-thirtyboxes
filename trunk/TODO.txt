High Prio
=========

- s/30boxes/30 boxes/ where reasonable because that is what others are using.
  Compare google:30boxes+api vs. google:30+boxes+api. I score in the first
  but not the second.
- move to google code
- update structure as my other projects
- fix up setup.py and put up on pypi
  

Med Prio
========

- What about "~/.30boxes/..." on Windows? My user_data_dir() relies on
  PyWin32 right now. Use fallbacks in Komodo code.
- Suggestions for 30boxes for API additions:
   - list tags (get all used tags)
   - optional start/end on search and tagsearch
   - allow implicit dates allowed in One Box for the events.Get()
     start and end arguments. E.g. start="tomorrow"
- Add parsed and formatted output for the commandline interface.
- Add (or fill out) docstrings for the API methods.
